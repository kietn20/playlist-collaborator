# File: frontend/nginx.conf
# Purpose: Nginx configuration to serve the static React app and proxy API calls.
# Location: frontend/ directory

# Define an upstream block for your backend service.
# 'backend-app' is the service name of your Spring Boot application in docker-compose.yml.
# Nginx will resolve this name to the backend container's IP address within the Docker network.
upstream backend_service {
    server backend-app:8080; # Service name and port from docker-compose.yml
}

server {
    listen 80; # Nginx will listen on port 80 inside its container
    server_name localhost; # Or your domain name if applicable

    # Root directory for static files (where index.html and other assets are)
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html index.htm;

    # Serve static files directly
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html; # Important for single-page applications (SPAs)
                                          # If a file/directory is not found, serve index.html
                                          # This allows React Router to handle client-side routing.
    }

    # Proxy API requests to the backend service
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://backend_service; # Forward to the upstream block defined above
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Optional: WebSocket proxying configuration if API gateway handles WebSockets too
        # (Not strictly needed if frontend connects directly to backend WS for /ws-playlist)
        # However, if you wanted Nginx to proxy WS requests on the same /api path:
        # proxy_http_version 1.1;
        # proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        # proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }

    # Optional: Custom error pages
    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html; # Or a different path for error pages
    }

    # Optional: Enable Gzip compression for static assets
