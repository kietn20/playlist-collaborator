# File: PLAYLIST-COLLABORATOR/.gitignore (ROOT of the entire Git repository)

### IDEs / Editors ###
# IntelliJ IDEA project files (if .idea is at the root for the whole monorepo)
.idea/

# VS Code (if .vscode is at the root)
.vscode/

# Other editor temp files or general logs
*.swp
*.swo
*~
*.bak
*.tmp

### OS Generated Files ###
# macOS
.DS_Store
.AppleDouble
.LSOverride
._*
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
Icon?

# Windows
Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db
Desktop.ini

### Node modules / Build artifacts (if accidentally created at root) ###
# These should ideally be handled by sub-project .gitignores,
# but adding them here can catch strays.
# node_modules/
# target/
# dist/
# build/

### Environment Files (if .env for docker-compose is at root and not backend/) ###
# If your .env and docker-compose.yml for the *backend* are inside the 'backend' folder,
# then 'backend/.env' should be in 'backend/.gitignore'.
# If you decide to move docker-compose.yml and its .env to the *root* of PLAYLIST-COLLABORATOR,
# then you would put '.env' here. Based on your screenshot, it's in 'backend/', so the
# current 'backend/.gitignore' handling '.env' is correct.

### Other generated files specific to your overall project ###
# Example: any top-level reports or logs
# coverage-report/
# project-docs/generated/

# Add any other global ignores here
